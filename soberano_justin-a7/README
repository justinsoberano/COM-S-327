How to run: 
    ./poke [FILE] | parses files on Pyrite
    ./poke home [FILE] | parses files on Home directory.

Home directory should be in this path in order for [ ./poke home ] to work.
$HOME/.poke327/pokedex/pokedex/data/csv/[FILE]
If it is not in this path, it will ask for a path.

For all commands:
    ./poke help

All assignment 1.07 files are located in /game/file_parsing

This version of my pokemon game only parses files. 
To implement functionality of assignment 1.06, uncomment line 3 of poke.cpp.

This program parses multiple CSV files related to Pokemon and their moves, structures the data into C++ structs or classes, and prints the contents to standard output. It is designed to work with a specific database structure and includes error handling for missing files.

Run the program with a single command-line parameter to specify the CSV file to parse. The parameter can be one of the following:
- pokemon
- moves
- pokemon_moves
- pokemon_species
- experience
- type_names
- pokemon_stats
- stats
- pokemon_types

The program will search for the database in the following order:
/share/cs327
$HOME/.poke327/
An optional third location of your choice.
