---------------
In this assignment, we will be adding functionality to our existing game, which was originally developed in C (as of version 1.02). The goal is to port the game to C++ and implement the following features:

Player Movement
- The player character (PC) can use movement keys to move into gates.
- Moving into a gate will transition the PC to the neighboring map, placing them in the road square directly abeam of the gate in the neighboring map.
- For example, moving west into a west gate at (0,10) in map (0,0) will place the PC at (78,10) in map (-1,0).
- NPCs cannot move into gates.
- Maintain turn queues per map

Fly Command
- Implement the ability for the PC to fly.
- The command 'f' indicates that the player wants to fly.
- The interface will prompt for X and Y coordinates.
- Place the PC within the destination map, with placement at your discretion (e.g., on the road).
- Maintain turn queues and NPC positions while flying.

Porting to C++
- Rename all C files with a .cpp extension.
- Update the makefile to compile C++ code and link with the C++ compiler.
- Change major structs in the game to classes, including map and character structures.s
