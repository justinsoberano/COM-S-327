How to run,
1. make
2. ./world --numtrainers (e.x ./world --7)
                                        ^ This will spawn 7 trainers, not providing a tag
                                          will default to 10.

Implemented a min-heap priority queue that uses the NPCs distance cost as the value to determine
which NPC goes first. The map refreshes 10 frames per second, using 'usleep(100000)'.

Hikers and Rivals use the calculated distance maps from 'djikstra_for_pc' 
and follow the gradient that leads to the player character.

The distance cost maps for Pacers, Wanderers, Explorers, and Sentries are calculated using the 
'other' costs in assignment 1.03.

- Pacers move back and forth, west and east.
- Wanderers start moving in a random direction, once they hit an area of land that is not
  the land that they spawned in, they start moving in a random direction
- Explorers have the same movement as Wanderer's except they can traverse different terrain types until
  they hit an invalid terrain type.
- Sentries dont move, and stay put wherever they are first placed.
